This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native with an object as the initial state.  If you attempt to modify the state directly (e.g., state.property = newValue), it won't trigger a re-render because you're mutating the original object instead of creating a new one.  React's reactivity relies on detecting changes by comparing references, and a mutated object has the same reference as the original.
